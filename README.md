# About
This is a testing project, done on a basic [API REST skeleton](https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton) written on JavaScript using async/await. All of the API testing was done using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) with [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/).
